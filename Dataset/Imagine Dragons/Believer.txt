Believer – Imagine
First thing’s first: I’mma say all the words inside my head
I’m fired up and tired of the way that things have been
Oh, Oooo
The way that things have been
Oh, Oooo
Second thing’s second: don’t you tell me what you think that I can be
I’m the one at the sail, I’m the master of my sea
Oh, Oooo
The master of my sea
Oh, Oooo
I was broken from a young age
Taking my sulking to the masses
Writing my poems for the few
That look at me, took from me, shook at me, feelin’ me
Singin’ from heartache from the pain
Takin’ my message from the veins
Speakin’ my lesson from the brain
Seein’ the beauty through the
You make a, you make a believer
You break me down and build me up, believer
Let the bullets fly, oh, let them rain
My life, my love, my job, they came from
You make me a, you make me a believer
Third thing’s third: send a prayer to the ones up above
All the hate that you’ve heard has turned your spirit to a dove
Oh, Oooo
Your spirit up above
Oh, Oooo
I was chokin’ in the ground
Buildin’ my rain up in the cloud
Fallin’ like ashes to the ground
Hoping my feelings, they would drown
But they never did, ever lived, ebbin’ and flowin’
Inhibited, Limited ‘til it broke open
It rained down
It rained down
You make a, you make a believer
You break me down and build me up, believer
Let the bullets fly, oh, let them rain
My life, my love, my job they came from
You make me a, you make a believer
Last thing’s last: by the grace of the fire and the flames
You’re the face of the future, the blood in my veins
Oh, Oooo
The blood in my veins
Oh, Oooo
But they never did, ever lived, ebbin’ and flowin’
Inhibited, limited, ‘til it broke open
It rained down
It rained down
You make me, you make a believer
You break me down, and build me up, believer
Let the bullets fly, oh, let them rain
My life, my love, my job, they come from
You make me a, you make me a believer
