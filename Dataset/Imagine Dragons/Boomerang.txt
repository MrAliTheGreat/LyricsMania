How many lies do we have to tell
To keep on saying that I wish you well?
How many times said to movin' on?
I know I'll see you tomorrow
'Cause I'm bad to lettin' you go, lettin' you go
Lettin' you go, lettin' you go
Moving on, moving on, moving on, moving on
I'm ready to go, ready to go
I'm ready to throw, ready to throw
You're my boomerang-boomerang
You're my boomerang-boomerang
How many tears do we have to cry?
How many sleepless, lonely nights?
To work it up, is it worth enough?
Should we go ahead? Or should we turn around?
I know I'll see you tomorrow
'Cause I'm bad to lettin' you go, lettin' you go
Lettin' you go, lettin' you go
Moving on, moving on, moving on, moving on
I'm ready to go, ready to go
I'm ready to throw, ready to throw
You're my boomerang-boomerang
You're my boomerang-boomerang
Just because it isn't easy doesn't means that it's wrong
Everything that we've been working on, working on so long
Ooh, ooh, ooh
You're my boomerang-boomerang
You're my boomerang-boomerang
You're my booma-booma-rang-rang
I'm ready to throw, ready to throw
You're my boomerang-rang
You're my boomerang-rang
I'm ready to throw, ready to throw
You're my boomerang-boomerang
You're my boomerang-boomerang
