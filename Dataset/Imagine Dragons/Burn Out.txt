Patience only gets you so far
Blood will get you further
Pain will only make your heart hard
Tossed and furies weather
Innocence is beautiful to see
Won't you box it up for me?
For me
Oh, give me strength, and give me peace
Does anyone out there watching hear me?
It's just another damn part, don't let it get the best of you
It's only up from the floor, light everything inside of you
Don't burn out, don't burn out on me
Don't burn out, don't burn out on me
Sadness is my enemy
I fear time will age him gently
Walking by myself after all these years
Seems that we've grown friendly
Happiness is beautiful to see
Won't you box it up for me?
For me
Oh, give me strength, and give me peace
Does anyone out there watching hear me?
It's just another damn part, don't let it get the best of you
It's only up from the floor, light everything inside of you
Don't burn out, don't burn out on me
Don't burn out, don't burn out on me
It's just another damn part
It's just another damn part
I won't give up
I, I won't give up
I, I won't give up
I, I won't
It's just another damn part, don't let it get the best of you
It's only up from the floor, light everything inside of you
I don't wanna let you go, I don't wanna let you go
Don't burn out, don't burn out on me
I don't wanna let you go, I don't wanna let you go
Don't burn out, don't burn out on me
