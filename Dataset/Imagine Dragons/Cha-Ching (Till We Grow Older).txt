I don't sleep so well at night
Waiting up and shivering
Hate is gone and money's tight
This little home that I'm living in
You've got to live your life
While your blood is boiling
These doors won't open
While you stand and watch them
Oh oh oh, what is with you?
Oh oh oh, I've never seen this side of you
Oh oh oh, what is with you?
Oh oh oh, I've never seen this side of you
We are all living
Till we grow older
You'll be the worker
I'll be the soldier
Now let me hear those sounds you sing to me
Cha ching, cha ching, cha chingaling
Now let me hear those sounds you sing to me
Cha ching, cha ching, cha chingaling
I don't think it's quite the same
Just running out to feel the rain
Staring as the stars parade
Are they telling me it's gonna be okay?
You've got to live your life
While your blood is boiling
These doors won't open
While you stand and watch them
Oh oh oh, what is with you?
Oh oh oh, I've never seen this side of you
We are all living
Till we grow older
You'll be the worker
I'll be the soldier
Now let me hear those sounds you sing to me
Cha ching, cha ching, cha chingaling
Now let me hear those sounds you sing to me
Cha ching, cha ching, cha chingaling
We are all living
Till we grow older
You'll be the worker
I'll be the soldier
Now let me hear those sounds you sing to me
Cha ching, cha ching, cha chingaling
Now let me hear those sounds you sing to me
Cha ching, cha ching, cha chingaling
We are all living
Till we grow older
You'll be the worker
I'll be the soldier
Now let me hear those sounds you sing to me
Cha ching, cha ching, cha chingaling
Now let me hear those sounds you sing to me
Cha ching, cha ching, cha chingaling
