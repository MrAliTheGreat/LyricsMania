Cool out, cool out
Just before I go
Yes I know that I'm losing control, yeah
Up on I take things slow open my mind lose control
I know I'm always spacing
In a blame of pressure facing
I wanna take things slow open my mind and cruse control
I'm stunning on your front port just saying "don't go"
You're lookin' at me wild saying "Just go home" and
Cool out, 'cause baby I don't think I'm the one for you
Just cool out, 'cause baby I don't think I'm the one for you
Cool out, stay high, stay fresh late nights
Just cool out, 'cause baby I don't think I'm the one for you
Just cool out
I always saying that you're read my soul and
Always wishing that I take the time but
You know there's no more speed
Only believe what I can see
I live my life in black and white
I know that's nothing but you lie
That's all I know, I run my mind and lose control
I'm stunning on your front port just saying "don't go"
You're lookin' at me wild saying "Just go home" and
Cool out, 'cause baby I don't think I'm the one for you
Just cool out, 'cause baby I don't think I'm the one for you, so
Cool out, stay high, stay fresh late nights
Just cool out, 'cause baby I don't think I'm the one for you
So cool out
All the things that you detest in me
They coming back from all see
Make each other get big crazy
But you'll always be a part of me
Cool out, 'cause baby I don't think I'm the one for you
Just cool out, 'cause baby I don't think I'm the one for you, so
Cool out, stay high, stay fresh late nights
Just cool out, 'cause baby I don't think I'm the one for you
So cool out
Cool out, cool out
