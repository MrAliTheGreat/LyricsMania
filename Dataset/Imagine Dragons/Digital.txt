You know how we do
I wanna a new world without the order
I wanna resurrect and live a little shorter
I want it heavy
I want the fury
I want to be like the judge and the jury
The outside everything moves right
From the outside, from the outside
The outside everything moves right
From the outside, from the outside
We are, we are the face of the future
We are, we are the digital heartbeat
We are, we are the face of the future
We don't wanna change, we just want to change everything
Hey, hey, hey, hey, digital, digital
Hey, hey, hey, hey, digital heartbeat
Hey, hey, hey, hey, digital, digital
We don't wanna change, we just want to change everything
I wanna a new world without the order
I wanna resurrect and live a little shorter
I want it heavy
I want the fury
I want to be like the judge and the jury
The outside everything moves right
From the outside, from the outside
The outside everything moves right
From the outside, from the outside
We are, we are the face of the future
We are, we are the digital heartbeat
We are, we are the face of the future
We don't wanna change, we just want to change everything
