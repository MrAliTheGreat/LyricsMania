Fast comes the blessing of all that you dreamed
But then comes the curses of diamonds and rings
Only at first did it have it's appeal
But now you can’t tell the false from the real
Who can you trust?
Who can you trust?
When everything, everything, everything you touch turns to gold, gold, gold
Everything, everything, everything you touch turns to gold, gold
Statues and empires are all at your hands
Water to wine and the finest of sands
When all that you have’s turnin’ stale and it’s cold
Oh, you no longer fear when your heart’s turned to gold
Who can you trust?
Who can you trust?
When everything, everything, everything you touch turns to gold, gold, gold
Everything, everything, everything you touch turns to gold, gold
I’m dying to feel again
Oh, anything at all
But, oh, I feel nothing, nothing, nothing,
When everything, everything, everything you touch turns to gold, gold, gold
Everything, everything, everything you touch turns to gold, gold
