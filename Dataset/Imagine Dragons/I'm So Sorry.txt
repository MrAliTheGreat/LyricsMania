About time for anyone telling you off for all your deeds
Not time the roaring thunder stopped in cold to read
I get mine and make no excuses
The sun shines on everyone
Everyone, love yourself to death
So you gotta fire up, you gotta let go
You'll never be loved 'til you make your own
You gotta face up, you gotta get yours
You'll never know the top till you get too low
Oh, a son of a
Oh, a son of a
I'm so sorry
Oh, a son of a
Oh, a son of a
I'm so sorry
No lies and no deceiving
Men is what he loves
I keep trying to conceive
I get mine and make no excuses
The sun shines on everyone
Everyone, love yourself to death
So you gotta fire up, you gotta let go
You'll never be loved til you make your own
You gotta face up, you gotta get yours
You'll never know the top till you get too low
Oh, a son of a
Oh, a son of
I'm so sorry
Oh, a son of a
Oh, a son of
I'm so sorry
Life isn't always what you think it'd be
Turn your head for one second and the tables turn
And I know, I know that I did you wrong
Will you trust me when I say that I'll make it up to you somehow
So you gotta fire up, you gotta let go
You'll never be loved til you've made your own
You gotta face up, you gotta get yours
You'll never know the top till you get too low
Oh, a son of a
Oh, a son of a
I'm so sorry
Oh, a son of a
Oh, a son of a
I'm so sorry
I'm so sorry
I'm so sorry
I'm so sorry
