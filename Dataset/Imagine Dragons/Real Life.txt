She says that the world is a broken mess
It's always on her mind
She cries at the news when the shots ring out
Every single time
No, I cannot fix it, no, I cannot make it stop
So I said, "Turn your phone off, only look me in my eyes
Can we live that real life, real life?"
Oh, hey, "Turn your phone off, only look me in my eyes
Can we live that real life, real life?"
Prays on her knees when the towers fall
To a God she does not know
She's begging him to stop the mess
She said, "How could I ever believe in something
That would step aside and watch?"
And I got no words to say 'cause I think I lost my faith
But I thank you for the day when everything will be okay
But no, I cannot fix it, and I cannot make it stop
So I said, "Turn your phone off, only look me in my eyes
Can we live that real life, real life?"
Oh, hey, "Turn your phone off, only look me in my eyes
Can we live that real life, real life?"
I wish I had the answers
Something you could hold too
Only thing that's real to me is
"Turn your phone off, only look me in my eyes
Can we live that real life, real life?"
Oh, hey, "Turn your phone off, only look me in my eyes
Can we live that real life, real life?"
Real life, real life
Oh, hey
Real life, real life
Oh, hey
