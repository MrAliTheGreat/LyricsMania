I was hoping for an indication
I was seeking higher elevation
I've been shaken, waking in the night light
I've been breaking, hiding from the spotlight
The more I stray, the less I fear
And the more I reach, the more I fade away
The darkness right in front of me
Oh, it's calling out, and I won't walk away
I would always open up the door
Always looking up at higher floors
I was always up for making changes
Walking down the street meeting strangers
Like a prayer that only needs a reason
Like a hunter waiting for the season
I was there, but I was always leaving
I've been living, but I was never breathing
The more I stray, the less I fear
And the more I reach, the more I fade away
The darkness right in front of me
Oh, it's calling out, and I won't walk away
I would always open up the door
Always looking up at higher floors
I was always up for making changes
Walking down the street meeting strangers
I'm bursting like the Fourth of July
So color me and blow me away
I'm broken in the prime of my life
So embrace it and leave me to stray
I would always open up the door
Always looking up at higher floors
I was always up for making changes
Walking down the street meeting strangers
I would always open up the door
Always looking up at higher floors
I was always up for making changes
Walking down the street meeting strangers
