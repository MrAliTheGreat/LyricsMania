I torture you
Take my hands through the flames
I torture you
I wanna chain you up
I'm just a sucker for pain
Take me next to the sun
And let me watch myself burn, it makes me feel I'm on one
Guillotine with a razor blade 'cause usual blades don't cut it
And it's just often way too mundane
French kissing and fellatio with vipers
Right after eat the feces out of my nephew's diapers
Then down it with some red juice off my bitch's snatch
While my fingers are stuck inside of a tortoise's ass
I'll sure be having the time of my life
Improving my freestyle as I'd never have to write
Might piss a dragon off for fun
'Cause I like the smell of my own flesh when it's roasted
I torture you
Take my hands through the flames
I torture you
I wanna chain you up
I'm just a sucker for pain
And every time that I'm asked to walk on eggshells
I'd replace them with layers of thorns and nails
Hell's probably gonna be raised
By the time I'm done with this verse
Literally and metaphorically
Well like a bitch begging to be fucked
I plead that I get drowned, that's my idea of
Getting my head wet, I do bath in toxins and
I wipe 'em off with Poison Ivy, yup!
Misery loves company
That's why I prefer to be in pain alone
Hurt me, it gives pleasure to me
My dick for a KIEL B ASA's probably
Cooking on your stove at home 'cause intercourse hurt me
I torture you
Take my hands through the flames
I torture you
I wanna chain you up
I'm just a sucker for pain
Uh, and if pain was a dick
I swear I wouldn't hesitate to suck that shit
Might be weird to the untrained mind
But if you love the shit the way I do
You'll be next in line
And how much more can I express myself?
Just don't fuck with my source of happiness
I'm helpless so I talk to the world, moon, and the stars
Hear my voice and set me up
For more pain
I've been dreaming of this err'day
And having wet dreams over it
For more pain
I've been living for the feeling
I might drink from the fountain of youth for it
For more pain
I quit hurting others so only I can get to feel the pain
It's greed
For more Pain
I've been rolling in the deep of boiling oil
And smiling hard
I'm dysfunctional
For more pain
Got me begging begging begging begging
For more pain
I've been begging begging begging begging
For more pain
Got me begging begging begging begging
For more pain
I've been begging
