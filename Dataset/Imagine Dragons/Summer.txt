If only for a second
Let me have you
Tell me all your secrets
Let me know you
Paint me all your pictures
Hang them on my wall
Show me all your colors
Show me all of those
Open up your eyes, open up your mind
Follow in line with what you're meant to be
Open up your eyes, open up your mind
Follow in line with what you're meant to be
A fire burns into you
Purifying all
And what I saw was opulence
And that's not for me
And that's not for me
And that's not for me
Only in the summertime
Only in the summertime
Things will change with time
Only in the summertime
Open up your eyes, open up your mind
Follow in line with what you're meant to be
Open up your eyes, open up your mind
Follow in line with what you're meant to be
Only in the summertime
Only in the summertime
Things will change with time
Only in the summertime
