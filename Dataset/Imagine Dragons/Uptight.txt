Say goodbye to all your friends
They will miss you when this trends
I get so uptight, I get so uptight
I get so uptight, I get so uptight
Why don't you beeline, outshine, everybody blow your mind, go
Why don't you see what they're saying, it's crazy, I've seen it
Those things they believe in, they get hazy, I think I mean it
I get so uptight, I get so uptight
I get so uptight, I get so uptight
Why don't you beeline, outshine, everybody blow your mind, go
Why don't you see what they're saying, it's crazy, I've seen it
Those things they believe in, they get hazy, I think I mean it
Why don't you beeline, outshine, everybody blow your mind, go
Why don't you see what they're saying, it's crazy, I've seen it
Those things they believe in, they get hazy, I think I mean it
