It's a cold, cold night, I'm sitting by the fire
'Cause every time, it's like this
You can tell the sun's setting, it's so sentimental
And every time I see your face
I'm all over the place
You look just like a lover does
And I'll wait for better days
So say you're all over the place
And I look just like a lover does
And even if I tried
I can't stay away from you
I can't stay away from you
I can't stay away from you
I can't stay away from you
Even if I tried
I can't stay away from you
I can't stay away from you
I can't stay away from you
I can't stay away from you
And even if I tried
It's a lonely world here, I'm on my own
The memories, they're still here
You told me that you felt it, it's all right here
Don't let it go now
Remember the days we'd go out?
Remember the days we'd slow down?
I do, I do
Remember this place like no doubt
Remember your face when it's loud
I do, I do
Your face, I'm all over the place
You look just like a lover does
And I'll wait for better days
So say you're all over the place
And I look just like a lover does
And even if I tried
I can't stay away from you
I can't stay away from you
I can't stay away from you
I can't stay away from you
And even if I tried
I can't stay away from you
I can't stay away from you
I can't stay away from you
I can't stay away from you
And even if I tried
I can't stay away from you
I can't stay away from you
I can't stay away from you
I can't stay away from you
And even if I tried
I can't stay away from you
I can't stay away from you
I can't stay away from you
I can't stay away from you
And even if I tried
I can't stay away from you
I can't stay away from you
I can't stay away from you
I can't stay away from you
Even if I tried
I can't stay away from you
I can't stay away from you
I can't stay away from you
I can't stay away from you
And even if I tried
I can't stay away from you
I can't stay away from you
I can't stay away from you
I can't stay away from you
Even if I tried
I can't stay away from you
