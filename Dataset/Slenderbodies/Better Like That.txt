I'm mended to my prime, heavy on my eyelids
Too like-able, too like-able
Steady all my life
Making any mindset shifts so probable
Yet you try to step, but you step awkward
You take a breath, but you’re bent outward
We'll make a friend, but we'll lose a couple
Let’s make pretend that were going backwards
It's better like that
It's better like that
It's better like that
I hate to say goodbyes
But it's the only time I get to talk to you, it's true
I could let it slide
Corner of my pupil's perspective neglected
Yet you try to step, but you step awkward
You take a breath, but you're bent outward
We’ll make a friend, but we’ll lose a couple
Let's make pretend that were going backwards
It’s better like that
It's better like that
Better like, better like, better like
Better like, ooh
Better like, ooh
Better like, ooh
Better like, ooh
Better like, ooh
Better like, ooh
Better like, ooh
