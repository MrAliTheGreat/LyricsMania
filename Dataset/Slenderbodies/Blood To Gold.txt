Drip out your mouth
Fall on the ground
Lying awake for a long time
Don’t make it loud
You’re golden now
Gather like hounds in the dog-pound
A little cat call
I want you
To leave me alone
Heavy blanket of your gold
Feel the fire i have been reborn
Think a puff is well deserved
Pray to someday be, evermore evermore
Sent my only pair of shoes away
Walked a mile with blistered feet in forest rains
I want to be your lover
I want to be your friend
I want to be your demon
I want to be your hell
Try to be your summer
Swimming in my eyes
Losing yourself
You never know what you’d find
I don’t want to see you cry anymore i need
A little smile every once in a while may-
Be you’ve been stuck in rut, let me
Turn your blood to gold, turn your blood to gold
