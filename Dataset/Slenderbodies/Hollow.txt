Slip back in my heart
Just slip back in my-
Ive been so empty with out you
Id follow you to the grave if you asked me
Theres something bout how you see the world
And all its been through its beauty never leaves ur side
Sweet thing you know I'm following
Your eyes, your eyes
Morning never looked so bright
'fore you were mine
You were mine
This hollow heart I dug
For you to step inside
Hoping you'd stay the night
Hoping you'd treat me right
Oooh you were mine
Ive been so empty with out you
Id follow you to the grave if you asked me
Theres something bout how you see the world
And all its been through its beauty never leaves ur side
Ive been so empty with out you
Ive been so empty with out you
You know im poised
To take all of your pain
To me its all the same
Just tell me what to say
Youve flown far
Forgot about the past
You think youre gonna crack
Think its all your fault
Just slip back in my heart
Just slip back in my-
