Spent my days
Locked away from your eyes
Letting myself create
A place
To getaway
Years to leave my mark as I grow old
Spent scheming
Visions I've had
Space that I belong
Home always whispers in my ear
Home is quite lovely i hear
Feels like home
It feels like home
Splash of paint
Watch its ends curl and dry
As sun rays escape
All i see is my little hideaway
Home always whispers in my ear
Home is quite lovely i hear
