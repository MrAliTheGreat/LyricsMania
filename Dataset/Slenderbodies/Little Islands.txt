Oh, I'm hoping
I get a bit of
I'm monotone
Ooh ooh ooh oh oh
Wanted a taste of above
Aah aah aah aah
Falling backwards
Us against the world
There's just nothing left to do here
Time to run over the bridges where we'll be just fine
You and I
You and I
Distant noise of sirens
Fade away on little islands
I don't want to be nobody else but me tonight
You and I
You and I
You tell me now
You tell me now
It's been so long since you’ve been making these decisions
Yet you want to know, you want to know
I think its fine to be a little bit nonsensical
Were riding out
Riding out
Finding places
I’ve been making
My mistakes out here with you
Us against the world
There's just nothing left to do here
Time to run over the bridges where we'll be just fine
You and I
You and I
Distant noise of sirens
Fade away on little islands
I don't want to be nobody else but me tonight
You and I
You and I
Far gone distance
Try to be the only one that listens
I want to be your only martyr
Maybe if i can be there for you
I can learn to be myself again
Far gone distance
Try to be the only one that listens
I want to be your only martyr
Maybe if i can be there for you
I can learn to be myself again
Us against the world
There's just nothing left to do here
Time to run over the bridges where we'll be just fine
You and I
You and I
Distant noise of sirens
Fade away on little islands
I don't want to be nobody else but me tonight
You and I
You and I
Us against the world
There's just nothing left to do here
Time to run over the bridges where we'll be just fine
You and I
You and I
Distant noise of sirens
Fade away on little islands
I don't want to be nobody else but me tonight
You and I
You and I
