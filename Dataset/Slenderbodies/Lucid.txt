Running feet
Sound of seas
Trouble me
I give into weariness
Half asleep
Until I can wake me up
Tell me that I'm ok
From the haze
Dripping in reflection
Suddenly you are here with me
Sweet and safe
Nothing else will matter anymore
I see my body yet im
Im floating way above
Hold in hysteria
The irony of it all
Of the future i hold
Wake me
I dont wanna devolve
Days too deep
Crows or keys
Rabbits feet
Hold it close i need the luck
Eyes on me
From the breeze
Peering at me from the dark
Tell you that i got something on my mind
Fooling you
Is all i do
Soon as you fall asleep
And make it here
Then you and i can be forever young
Tell me im a loon
When i want a little dosage
Let me fall in your arms
I ain't gonna lose it
Like an old soul
Let me inch a little closer
Find my way back home
Way back home
