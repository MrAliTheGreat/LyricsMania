So hung up
Got sun sitting in my blood
I want to leave
To dip my feet
I spent some time
To search for a place to hide
I saw your face from underneath
Drip away
My vision flawless
As I await your full reveal
I am captivated
You reel me in
Steps from shame
I wanna see your whole body sway
I step inside as you call my name
You let me in
Falling through the symphonies
I just wanna hear your voice
Hidden in-between theirs
Melt into cacophony
Ringing in my ears is yours
Swimming through the white noise
Gasp of air
A grasp of something is all I need
Maybe you
Could be the one that will deceive me
Sing your songs
Enchant my senses with your stories
Make me feel like
I will never be left lonely
Drip away
My vision flawless
As I await your full reveal
I am captivated
You reel me in
Steps from shame
I wanna see your whole body sway
I step inside as you call my name
You let me in
Falling through the symphonies
I just wanna hear your voice
Hidden in-between theirs
Melt into cacophony
Ringing in my ears is yours
Swimming through the white noise
