You said you were one of us
Sitting around the wildfire
Sinning around with a wild side
She said that you were one of us
One of the kids from back in our day
When the world was more lonely
Be cool to her
Don't act like a fool because
You're one of us, one of us, one of us
Don't try to offer her the silly things you do on a day-to-day basis
Because you're one of us, one of us one, one of us
You're one of us, you're one of us, you're one of us
You're one of us, one of us
You said you'll never run from us
Told us that you're ours until you're dead and gone
But you're running from us now
And chasing after her won't get her heart to trust you again
Since you became the one who tore her heart apart as a friend
You won't be one of us, one of us, one of us
Be cool for her
Don't act like a fool because
You're one of us, one of us, one of us
Don't try to offer her the silly things you do on a day-to-day basis
Because you're one of us, you're one of us, one of us, one of us
One of us, one of us, one of us
One of us, one of us, one of us
