Lens flare aching as it covers our eyes
Been so late I've been a cannibal
I carry along
I carry along
Glossed over all the fine lines
Cold crisp cream inside a silky spine
I've been carried along
I've been carried along
Loose leaves spill over my sanity
Wilted winds will me
Loose leaves spill over my sanity
Wilted winds will me
I've been seeing in blue
I've been feeling in blue
When I'm with you
I've been sinning in blue
I've been blooming into muted motion
Opal ocean north shore floats in
Opal ocean slowly flows in
Loose leaves spill over my sanity
Wilted winds will me
Loose leaves spill over my sanity
Wilted winds will me
I've been seeing in blue
I've been feeling in blue
When I'm with you
I've been sinning in blue
I've been blooming into muted motion
