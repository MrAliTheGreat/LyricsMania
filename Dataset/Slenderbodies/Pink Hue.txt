You were my one love
In that place where black-tails roam
You were my one love
Away from home
Lay with me
Be it briefly
Come close, I’m coming clean
Pupils sway
In bauble blues
Do you feel as I do?
Lamenting light
Once in your eyes
September’s sunsets
Cascade the night
A pink hue
Surrounds you
I don’t know why
You don’t take your time to think twice
A pink hue surrounds you
Makes me wanna feel alive
I’ll take you places where you wanna go
I’ll take your pain and make your body whole
It’s such a shame the way you treat your bones
I see your glow i see your afterglow
