Looking down from above
The sky by my fingertips the polychrome below
You wanna play it out
Walking through a sea of colors
Floating through
I wanna see you lie down
It's so surreal
Dance with the crystals down below
Spend all my time to let it go
You wanna play it out
Of my mind
I feel so right
Stop me if you want it all
Hold me down and beg
I still won't give you anything
Spent time in a polychrome
Still i got my head right
Still i got my head right
I feel alright
I feel alright
Still i got my head right
Still i got my head right
All my thoughts tesselate for you
It's been so wrong
It's been so wrong
A single breath i drew from you
It's been so long
It's been so long
I feel so right
Stop me if you want it all
Hold me down and beg
I still won't give you anything
Spent time in a polychrome
Still i got my head right
Still i got my head right
I feel alright
I feel alright
Don't wanna be in it all
Don't wanna be in it
I wanna be in it all
I wanna be in it
