Feeling your pressure)
Feeling your pressure
Feeling your pressure
Maybe we could spend the night together
Feeling your pressure
Feeling your pressure
Maybe we could spend the night together
I've been a madman
I've been a madman all my life
It's been so obvious
Maybe if you
Took a look at me
Spent a minute matching skin with eyes
It's been a long night out
Swaying on my feet
This subtle mess has got me weak
A drink or two might lighten up my sleep
If you want me
I can stay here nightly
Maybe for the weekend
We can spend it under pressure, pressure, under pressure
Your pressure, your pressure, yeah
Feeling your pressure
Feeling your pressure
Maybe we could spend the night together
Feeling your pressure
Feeling your pressure
Maybe we could spend the night together
If you might
I've been calling your name all night
I just want you to be all mine
You seem to be my type
One more time
I just want you to spend the night
I've been waiting for you some time
Feeling your pressure
Feeling your pressure
Maybe we could spend the night together
Feeling your pressure
Feeling your pressure
Maybe we could spend the night together
I've been calling your name all night
I just want you to be all mine
