Ive been here for far too long still got too much to do
I heard these words a thousand times but nothing sticks like you
Ive been here, in the moment
I saw it so clear
Its all in your eyes
I wanna be yours and you wanna be mine
Lets take our time, were living so sublime
Ive been breathing through the night so free
All these thoughts unwind
Riding up my body to my ears
Too many times
Today, ive been alone, for too long too long too long too long yea
Ive known your ways, for too long too long too long too long now
Just slipped away ive been gone for too long too long too long too long now
So heres the place i belong belong its been long too long now
Finally got myself to feel a bit better
Had a bit of spare time to spend how id like
Took a second to appreciate your beauty
Still impressed at how you make me feel so sublime
