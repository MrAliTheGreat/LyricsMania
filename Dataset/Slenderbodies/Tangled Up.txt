Nuisance, blue-eyed
Hold it another night
It's too late, it's too right
All in paradise
Cupid's gone blind
Watching, mesmerized
I slow down, you're paralyzed
So hold mine
Oily, skin tight
Goosebumps, shiver light
Without you, it's cold out
I won't lie, I won't let up
There's no wrong at these heights
So know that it's just fine
We're losing daylight
There's no time, but it's alright
We'll still end up
Tangled up between the folds
Tangled up between 'em
Tangled up between the folds
Tangled up
Tangled up between the folds
Tangled up between 'em
Tangled up between the folds
Tangled up
Tangled up between the folds
Tangled up between 'em
Tangled up between the folds
Tangled up
Tangled up between the folds
Tangled up between 'em
Tangled up between the folds
Tangled up
Blushing, red skin
Tingle to the touch, now let me in
Moving, you and I
Just keep me satisfied
There's no wrong at these heights
So know that it's just fine
We're losing daylight
There's no time, but it's alright
We'll still end up
We'll still end up
Tangled up between the folds
Tangled up between 'em
Tangled up between the folds
Tangled up
Tangled up between the folds
Tangled up between 'em
Tangled up between the folds
Tangled up
Tangled up between the folds
Tangled up between 'em
Tangled up between the folds
Tangled up
Tangled up between the folds
Tangled up between 'em
Tangled up between the folds
Tangled up
Tangled up between the folds
Tangled up between 'em
Tangled up between the folds
Tangled up
Tangled up between the folds
Tangled up between 'em
Tangled up between the folds
Tangled up
Tangled up between the folds
Tangled up between 'em
Tangled up between the folds
Tangled up
