Bend around the road
I give away my silhouette
Nothing holds you like the sun, no
I'm youthful in the morning light
I speak highly of my own life
Though it seems like I'm living right
Maybe you could tell me I'm a little off, a little off
Mmm, yeah
Flakes are peeling, falling on my skin
Seek my reasons, dance until the end
So wait until it's said and done
Then make amends and move along
You're stranded right where you belong
And maybe it's intentional
Maybe it's not bad at all
Wading in subliminal
You're stranded, but you have it all
And maybe it's intentional, intentional
Tryna chase a stone, yeah, we did it on our own
Caught us rolling on the floor by the bedside
Resuscitated tone that reminds us of the ones
That we met along the road from our own tribe
All the strangers left our fingers feeling warm
Flakes are peeling, falling on my skin
Receive my reasons, dance until the end
So wait until it's said and done
Then make amends and move along
You're stranded right where you belong
And maybe it's intentional
Maybe it's not bad at all
Wading in subliminal
You're stranded, but you have it all
And maybe it's intentional, intentional
It helps depending on the people that you said you'll always love
Only in your life you'll share these chemicals
