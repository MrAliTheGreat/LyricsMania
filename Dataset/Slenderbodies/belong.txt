God damn, I didn't see it
When you lived here all your life, I didn't mean it
And I swear, I know I greeted
But it's hard sometimes to breathe in on the ceiling
Dream of palaces and countrysides
All I want, want, want, want
Is to wake up with the morning light
Laughing all alone
Break away from all the city lights
Hiding in the dark
'Cause you don't belong where you don't belong
Yeah, I don't belong
No, I don't belong
No, I don't belong
No, I don't belong
No, I don't belong
And I don't belong where I don't belong
Yeah, yeah
Da-da-da-da, mmm
I'm blessed
I'll believe it when they tell me I'm here for a reason
Hold on, another season
Couple minutes back and forth, then we'll be leaving
To our palaces and countrysides
All I want, want, want, want
Is to wake up with the morning light
Laughing all alone
Break away from all the city lights
Hiding in the dark
'Cause you don't belong where you don't belong
Yeah, I don't belong
No, I don't belong
No, I don't belong
No, I don't belong
No, I don't belong
And I don't belong where I don't belong
No, no
It's just a feeling, just a feeling
It's just a feeling, just a feeling
It's just a feeling, just a feeling
It's just a feeling, just a feeling
Dream of palaces and countrysides
All I want, want, want, want
Is to wake up with the morning light
Laughing all alone
Break away from all the city lights
Hiding in the dark
'Cause you don't belong where you don't belong
Yeah, I don't belong
No, I don't belong
No, I don't belong
No, I don't belong
No, I don't belong
And I don't belong where I don't belong
