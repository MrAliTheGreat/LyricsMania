Heard you found the door
You've been there before
Now it's time for you to go away from me
Sentimental, sure
Reaching 84
Oh, I don't want to lose what you made of me
"18, oh the finest"
Made me think about it
I didn't know you wanted
Didn't know you wanted
With every try, each expression
In spite the light in my reflection
With such a life, I'm sad to see your night go
Na-ooh, oh
Ah-ooh, oh
It's funny how this seems to be the way to end it
It's funny how this seems to be the way to end it
It's funny how this seems to be the way to end it
It's funny how this seems to be the way
It's funny how this seems to be the way to end it
It's funny how this seems to be the way to end it
It's funny how this seems to be the way to end it
It's funny how this seems to be the way
It's funny how this seems to be the way to end it
It's funny how this seems to be the way to end it
It's funny how this seems to be the way to end it
It's funny how this seems to be the way
It's funny how this seems to be the way to end it
It's funny how this seems to be the way to end it
It's funny how this seems to be the way to end it
It's funny how this seems to be the way
Heard you'd been found
I heard you'd been found
