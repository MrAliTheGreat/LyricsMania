Find the delight
That you didn't know
Call it something sweeter
Like water on the stone
And maybe you did nothing
Nothing here at fault
You're sending to the pleasance
You've made inside this home
A dewdrop
It trickles over you
Crystal ceiling glowing blue
Hard to say that you'll go soon
It's all for you
Lock the door and find your muse
Breathing deep and letting loose
Close your eyes and make your move
It's all for you
It's all for you
Timeless feeling
Like oceans on the moon
You're sprawled out on a Sunday
Receiving from a spoon
The crackle from the fire
Is scented like the sun
And all of your desires
Are melting into one
A dewdrop
It trickles over you
Crystal ceiling glowing blue
Hard to say that you'll go soon
It's all for you
All the petals cling to you
Different shades of subtle hues
Lush reminders to imbue
It's all for you
It's all for you
It's all for you
It's all for you
It's all…
