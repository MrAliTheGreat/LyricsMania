Something in the air tonight
Boiling from the candlelight
Scents among us all
Clothes strewn on the floor
As we wallow in nothing
Potent from the time
Keeping up on smiles
Liquid down your spine
Twirling on a vine
As we wallow in nothing
In nothing
Yeah, we wallow in nothing
Yeah, we wallow in nothing
Yeah, we wallow in nothing
Saying that we're fine
Yet we wallow in nothing
Something in the air tonight
Dipping toes into moonlight
Hid in our cocoons
Slunk into our pools
As we wallow in nothing
In nothing
Yeah, we wallow in nothing
Yeah, we wallow in nothing
Wallow in nothing
Saying that we're fine
Yet we wallow
Wallow, wallow, yeah
Yeah, we wallow, wallow, yeah
Yeah, we wallow, wallow
Saying that we're fine
Yet we wallow in nothing
Come get it, I get it
I swore I'd always be the one
Come get it, I get it
I didn't want to see you run
Wallow, wallow, yeah
Yeah, we wallow, wallow, yeah
Yeah, we wallow, wallow
Saying that we're fine
Yet we wallow in nothing
Come get it, I get it
Come get it, I get it
Saying that we're fine
Yet we wallow in nothing
