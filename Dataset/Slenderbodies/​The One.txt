Say if something's wrong, held it all along
Made a mess up
Cleaned it just for fun, you could be the one
You could be the one to take my breath away

You could be the one to take my breath away
You could be the one to take my breath away
You could be the one to take my breath away
Feeling better
Say if something's wrong, held it all along
Made a mess up
Cleaned it just for fun, you could be the one
You could be the one to, you could be the one to
You could be the one to, you could be the one to
