And leaning backwards
Following all the rules
You left
Baby steps
Long, laborious lobotomy
Performed on me
Woke every night
Same questions asked
I don't remember
It's been so long, yet I remember you like scars
A perfect picture, everyday
It's been so long, yet I remember how it was
I used to be your everything and anything
Since I've been gone, I've been forgetting all I was
But you're still clearer than the day, everyday
Come down
Come home
Melt in morphine
All alone
Still alive
Still whole
Still in toxic chemicals
Still intoxicated love
Dizzy mess inside my bones
I still remember
I still remember
Now I feel a little hypnotized
Sentimental of your scent tonight
Sent my mental off, I feel just fine
Got my heart; it's all need this time
It's been so long, yet I remember you like scars
A perfect picture, everyday
It's been so long, yet I remember how it was
I used to be your everything and anything
Since I've been gone, I've been forgetting how I was
But you're still clearer than the day, everyday
