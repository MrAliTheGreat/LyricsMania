My mood's dependin’ on you, ah
Our moods' dependent on the sun
My mood's dependin’ on you, ah
Our moods' dependent on the sun
Float, keep it
Written on my sleeve, I'm a lost boy
Ready to overtake your fate
And now I know this place, yeah
Feeling winter's teeth all at once now
Ready to overtake your fate
How some try to feed it later
Hard to be alone when it's all faded
Don't know what's whole, don't know how to lay there
What is goin on? What is going on?
My mood’s dependin’ on you, ah
Our moods' dependent on the sun
My mood’s dependin' on you, ah
Our moods' dependent on the sun
Mmm, na-mm, ah-mm
Ah-mm, ah-mm, ah-mm
Mmm, na-mm, ah-mm
Ah-mm, ah-mm, ah-mm
Mmm, na-mm, ah-mm
My mood's dependin’ on you, ah
Our moods' dependent on the sun
My mood's dependin' on you
Our moods' dependent on the sun
My mood's dependin' on you
Our moods' dependent on the sun
