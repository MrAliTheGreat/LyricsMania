Warm form don't take that long
Gone, gone, gone, gone
Stone thrown won't fake at all
Won't, won't, won't
If you heard what I said, would you follow?
I could be anything that you borrow
If you suddenly seem like a lost soul
Let it be, let it be 'til tomorrow
So stay, stay, stay, stay
Don't behave-have-have-have
You don't have to ruminate-nate-nate-nate
I would have you any way, way, way, way
So stay, stay, stay, stay
Don't behave-have-have-have
You don't have to ruminate-nate-nate-nate
I would have you any way, way, way, way
Lay down, don't be callow
Won't help you grow
Slow down in deep shadows
Glow, glow
If you heard what I said, would you follow?
I could be anything that you borrow
If you suddenly seem like a lost soul
Let it be, let it be 'til tomorrow
So stay, stay, stay, stay
Don't behave-have-have-have
You don't have to ruminate-nate-nate-nate
I would have you any way, way, way, way
So stay, stay, stay, stay
Don't behave-have-have-have
You don't have to ruminate-nate-nate-nate
I would have you any way, way, way, way
