I know this isn't what I wanted
I never thought it'd come this far
Just thinkin' back to where we started
And how we lost all that we are.
We were young and times were easy
But I could see it's not the same
I'm standing here but you don't see me
I'd give it all for that to change
And I don't want to lose her
Don't wanna let her go
I'm standing out in the rain
I need to know if it's over
Cause I will leave you alone
Flooded with all this pain
Knowing that I'll never hold her
Before the storm
With every strike of lightning
Comes a memory that lasts
And not a word is left unspoken
As the thunder starts to crash
Maybe I should give up.
I'm standing out in the rain
I need to know if it's over
Cause I will leave you alone
Flooded with all this pain
Knowing that I'll never hold her
Like I did before the storm
Trying to keep the lights from going out
And the clouds from ripping out my broken heart
We always say,
A heart is not a whole
Without the one who gets you through the storm
Standin' out in the rain
Knowing that it's really over
Please don't leave me alone.
I'm flooded with all this pain,
Knowing that I'll never hold you
Like I did before the storm
Like I did before,
The storm.
