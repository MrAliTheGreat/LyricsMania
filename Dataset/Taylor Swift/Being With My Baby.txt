All is quiet in the world tonight
Counting stars and fireflies
When summer sings a lullaby
For me and my baby
On the hood of his Daddy's car
We pass around his old guitar
Bet Mama's wondering where we are
It's just me and my baby
The world is spinning round
Look just what I've found
Ooh, life's so sweet right here
Ooh, keeping it young and crazy
Ooh, just wanna stay right here
Cause nothing's quite like
Being with my baby
Driving home by the riverside
Wishing I could slow down time
And take a picture of my mind
Of me and my baby
The car pulls up and I'm home too late
We didn't take that interstate
Those back roads were a better way
For me and my baby
The closer that we get
I know I can't leave yet
Ooh, life's so sweet right here
Ooh, keeping it young and crazy
Ooh, just wanna stay right here
Cause nothing's quite like
Being with my baby
We both know what we've found
So he turns that car around
Ooh, life's so sweet right here
Ooh, keeping it young and crazy
Ooh, just wanna stay right here
Cause nothing's quite like
Being with my baby
