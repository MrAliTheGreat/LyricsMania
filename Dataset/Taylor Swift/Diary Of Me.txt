I'm a laid back t-shirt, blue jean, mood ring kinda girl
Hey, yeah, what's a word on you?
Lay low, I'm a mission rebel, angel devil
Little left of the middle
Sometimes I get temperamental
Here I am, an open book
Turn the page, it's all the range
Get a look on the inside
What you get is what you see
Baby, you hold the key to the diary of me
I'm poetry, complicated, simply stated
Hey, yeah, baby, how about you?
I was born free
I'm a cell phone hippie, are you with me?
When I mess up, I don't get up
I just get down to you
Here I am, an open book
Turn the page, it's all the range
Get a look on the inside
What you get is what you see
Baby, you hold the key to the diary of me
It's raining on Sunday, there's nothing on tv
Yesterday was lonely, you're the only one who gets me
My mind is like an island drifting through the ocean
I can't stop thinking about you
I bet you're thinking of me too
But here I am, an open book
Turn the page, it's all the range
Get a look on the inside
What you get is what you see
Baby, you hold the key to the diary of me, yeah
Here I am, an open book
Turn the page, it's all the range
Get a look on the inside
What you get is what you see
Baby, you hold the key to the diary of me
