I wanna be your endgame
I wanna be your first string
I wanna be your endgame, endgame
Big reputation, big reputation
Ooh, you and me, we got big reputations, ah
And you heard about me, ooh
Big reputation, big reputation
You like the bad ones, too
You so dope, don't overdose
Im so stoked, I need a toast
We do the most, I'm in the Ghost like I'm whippin a boat
You hold me down, and I protect you with my life
I don't wanna touch you, I don't wanna be
Just another ex-love, you dont wanna see
Like the other girls do
I dont wanna hurt you, I just wanna be
Drinking on a beach with you all over me
But I ain't tryna play
I wanna be your endgame, endgame
Knew her when I was young
Reconnected when we were little bit older, both sprung
I got issues and chips on both of my shoulders
Reputation precedes me, in rumors, I'm knee-deep
The truth is, it's easier to ignore it, believe me
Even when wed argue, we'd not do it for long
And you understand the good and bad end up in the song
For all your beautiful traits, and the way you do it with ease
For all my flaws, paranoia, and insecurities
I've made mistakes and made some choices, that's hard to deny
After the storm, something was born on the 4th of July
I've passed days without fun, this endgame is the one
With four words on the tip of my tongue, I'll never say it
I don't wanna touch you, I don't wanna be
Just another ex-love you don't wanna see
Like the other girls do
I don't wanna hurt you, I just wanna be
Drinking on a beach with you all over me
I know what they all say, yeah
But I ain't tryna play
I wanna be your endgame, endgame
Big reputation, big reputation
Ooh, you and me, we got big reputations, ah
And you heard about me, ooh
I got some big enemies
Hey, big reputation, big reputation
Ooh, you and me would be a big conversation, ah
And I heard about you, ooh
You like the bad ones, too
I hit you like bang, we tried to forget it, but we just couldn't
And I bury hatchets, but I keep maps of where I put 'em
Reputation precedes me, they told you I'm crazy
I swear I don't love the drama, it loves me
And I can't let you go, your hand prints on my soul
It's like your eyes are liquor, it's like your body is gold
You've been calling my bluff on all my usual tricks
So here's the truth from my red lips
I wanna be your endgame, endgame
I wanna be your endgame, endgame
