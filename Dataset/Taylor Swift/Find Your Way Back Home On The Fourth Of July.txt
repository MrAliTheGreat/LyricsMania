We were both young when I first saw you. Cause baby your a firework come on
Let your colors burst. Last Christmas I gave you my heart but the very next
Day you gave it away. You change your mind like a girl changes clothes.Then you can always find your way back home the fourth of July wherever I go.
Chrous:The best of both worlds.
Girls will always hold tight with a catperiller in the tree when they are welcome back home after the day of forth July; they can't go to far away from friends and family, but they can wish to be home again soon on the road again after sun sets in the colurful skies on the fourth of july; with butterfly fly away, butterfly fly away always witha beautiful copper wings across
The skies tonight.
These copper birds shall flap their copper glow wings while we girls makes are dreams to come true; as we been waiting for, don't know how to find our way back home on the fourth of july.
The fourth of July will never fade away from us forever, we will always remeber this day forever in our hearts when headed home on the road again after the sun sets in the spotlight tonight.
