That's the...
I could you
Can't sing in my room alone...
I can't eat, I can't sleep no...
And I wanna pick up my phone...
But I can't speak, I can't breath
'cause you're not here, with me...
You're my everything.
And I can't stand and see another
Man making your smile, your smile
'cause you're not here, with me...
You're my everything.
And I can't stand and see another
Man making your smile, your smile
I gotta let you go, you
Were mine things that
We were don't to fight
But I was blind and now
I know that I'm all alone, all alone
I was dumb, I was wrong
Now I'm wishing you come
Back but tonight...
Now I'm still home.
She was the one I love
Get away, get away
Get away, get away
Get away, get away from me
She was the one I love
Get away, get away
Get away, get away
Get away, get away from me
Baby I want you to know,
That we were supposed to go
So far away, so far away...
But I like you going even now
Regred what did your mother,
Baby I'm not that to try to
Hurt this, to us together
Now and never
'cause you're now here, with me...
You're my everything.
And I can't stand and see
Another man making your smile, your smile
'cause you're not here, with me...
You're my everything.
And I can't stand and see
Another man maki
