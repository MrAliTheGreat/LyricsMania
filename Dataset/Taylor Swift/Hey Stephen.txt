Hey Stephen
I know looks can be deceiving
But I know I saw a light in you
As we walked
We were talking
I didn't say
Half the things I wanted to
Of all the girls
Tossing rocks at your window
I'll be the one waiting there
Even when it's cold
Hey Stephen
Boy you might have me believing
I don't always have to be alone
Cause I can't help it if you look like an angel
Can't help it if I wanna kiss you in the rain so
Come feel this magic
I been feelin' since I met you
Can't help it if there's no one else
Mmm I can help myself
Hey Stephen
I been holdin back this feelin'
So I got some things to say to you, ha
I've seen it all so I thought that I'd
Never see nobody shine the way you do
The way you walk
Way you talk
Way you say my name
It's beautiful, wonderful
Don't you ever change
Hey Stephen
Why are people always leavin
I think you and I should stay the same
Cause I can't help it if you look like an angel
Can't help it if I wanna kiss you in the rain so
Come feel this magic
I been feelin' since I met you
Can't help it if there's no one else
Mmm I can't help myself
The dim in the street lights
You're perfect for me
Why aren't you here tonight?
Waiting alone now
So come on and come out
And pull me near
And shine, shine, shine
Hey Stephen
I could give you fifty reasons
Why I should be the one you choose
All those other girls
Well they're beautiful but
Would they write a song for you?
I can't help it if you look like an angel
Can't help it if I wanna kiss you in the rain so
Come feel this magic
I been feelin' since I met you
Can't help it if there's no one else
Mmm I can't help myself
If you look like an angel
Can't help it if I wanna kiss you in the rain so
Come feel this magic
I been feelin' since I met you
Can't help it if there's no one else
Mmm I can help myself
