I bet this time of night youre still up
I bet youre tired from a long, hard week
I bet youre sitting in your chair by the window, looking out at the city
And I bet sometimes you wonder about me
And I just want to tell you
It takes everything in me not to call you
And I wish I could run to you
And I hope you know that
Everytime I dont,
I almost do, I almost do
I bet you think I either moved on or hate you
Cause each time you reach out theres no reply
I bet it never, ever occurred to you that I cant say hello to you
And risk another goodbye
And I just want to tell you
It takes everything in me not to call you
And I wish I could run to you
And I hope you know that
Everytime I dont,
I almost do, I almost do
We made quite a mess, babe
Its probably better off this way
And I confess, babe
That in my dreams youre touching my face
And asking me if I want to try again with you
And I almost do
And I just want to tell you
It takes everything in me not to call you
And I wish I could run to you
And I hope you know that
Everytime I dont,
I almost do, I almost do
I bet this time of night youre still up
I bet youre tired from a long, hard week
I bet youre sitting in your chair by the window, looking out at the city
And I hope sometimes you wonder about me
