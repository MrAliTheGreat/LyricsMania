You stand with your hand on my waistline
It's a scene and we're out here in plain sight
I can hear them whisper as we pass by
Something happens when everybody finds out
See the vultures circling dark clouds
Love's a fragile little flame
It could burn out, it could burn out
Cause they got the cages, they got the boxes
And guns
They are the hunters, we are the foxes
And we run
Baby, I know places we won't be found
And they'll be chasing their tails trying to track us down
Cause I, I know places we can hide
I know places, I know places
Lights flash and we'll run for the fences
Let them say what they want, we won't hear it
Loose lips sink ships all the damn time
Not this time
Just grab my hand and don't ever drop it
My love
They are the hunters, we are the foxes
And we run
Baby, I know places we won't be found
And they'll be chasing their tails trying to track us down
Cause I, I know places we can hide
I know places, I know places
They are the hunters, we are the foxes
And we run
Just grab my hand and don't ever drop it
My love
Baby, I know places we won't be found
And they'll be chasing their tails trying to track us down
Cause I, I know places we can hide
I know places, I know places
They take their shots, we're bulletproof
And you know for me, it's always you
In the dead of night, you'll act so brave
And I know for you, it's always me
