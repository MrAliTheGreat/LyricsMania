Throwing pennies at the fountain,
When you're standing on a mountain,
It's kinda hard to aim.
But like the trees we cut our names in,
There must be an explanation,
Guess it didn't given off rain.
I need reasons why you're leaving
Well I guess I wished on a plane,
I thought it was a star,
I guess what you wrote on a paper
Wasn't really from your heart
'Cause once you said you loved me
I guess heard you wrong
And I guess I wished on a plane
And I thought it was a star.
Driving off into the deepen,
Honestly believe you'd be there,
When I jumped in,
Is an... Story,
We had the perfect love story, is the ending.
Nothing comes true, When it comes to youuu.
Well I guess I wished on a plane, I thought it was a star,
I guess what you wrote on a paper
Wasn't really from your heart
'Cause once you said you loved me
I guess heard you wrong
And I guess I wished on a plane
And I thought it was a star.
And I was too cloudy,
It's not my fault I just couldn't see.
Well I guess I wished on a plane,
I thought it was a star,
I guess what you wrote on a paper
Wasn't really in your heart
'Cause once you said you loved me
I guess heard you wrong
And I guess I wished on a plane
And I thought it was a star.
Throwing pennies at the fountain,
When you're standing on a mountain,
It's kinda hard to aim.
