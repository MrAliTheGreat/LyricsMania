I guess you really did it this time
Left yourself in your war path
Lost your balance on a tight rope
Lost your mind trying to get it back
Wasn't it easier in your lunchbox days
Always a bigger bed to crawl into
Wasn't it beautiful when you believed in everything
And everybody believed in you
It's alright, just wait and see your string of lights are still bright to me
Oh, who you are is not where you've been
You're still an innocent, still an innocent
Did some things you can't speak of
But at night you'll live it all again
You wouldn't be shattered on the floor now
If only you had seen what you know now then
Wasn't it easy in your firefly catching days
Everything out of reach, someone bigger brought down to you
Wasn't it beautiful running wild till you fell asleep
Before the monsters caught up to you
It's alright just wait and see your string of lights are still bright to me
Oh, who you are is not where you've been
You're still an innocent
It's okay, life is a tough crowd
32 and still growing up now
Who you are is not what you did
You're still an innocent
Time turns flames to embers
You'll have new Septembers
Everyone of us has messed up too
Minds change like the weather
I hope you remember.
Today is never too late to
Be brand new
Oh, it's alright just wait and see your string of lights are still bright to me
Oh, who you are is not where you've been
You're still an innocent
It's okay life is a tough crowd
32 and still growing up now
Who you are is not what you did
You're still an innocent
Still an innocent
Lost your balance on a tight rope
Oh, it's never too late to get it back.
