She didn't have a reason to go, oh no
She didn't have a reason to stay
Either way she didn't tell anyone by the first ray of sun,
She looked at her keys and found a reason to run
And time stands still, when you're nowhere bound,
But I understand that somehow
If I could drive all night
Would I find my peace of mind
Would it be a million miles of cold white lines
And unfamiliar exit signs
I'd just drive on by,
Just south of knowing why
I didn't really know her that well,
But I could tell that her smile Was only something to hide behind.
She felt so out of touch, Cause she just felt too much
If you don't know what you want Nothings ever enough And time stands still,
When you're nowhere bound,
That's where I'm headed right now
If I could drive all night
Would I find my peace of mind
Would it be a million miles of cold white lines
And unfamiliar exit signs
I'd just drive on by,
Just south of knowing why
I don't have a plan
I don't have a map
I don't even know if I'm ever going back
And I don't have a when
And I don't have a where
I don't even know if I'll know when I'm there
But If I could drive all night
Would I find my peace of mind
Would it be a million miles of cold white lines
And unfamiliar exit signs
I'd just drive on by,
I just drive on by
Drive all
Drive all
Drive all night
If I could drive all
Drive all
Drive all night
Just south of knowing why
