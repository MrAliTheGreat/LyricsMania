I still remember the look on your face
Lit through the darkness at 1:58
The words that you whispered for just us to know
You told me you loved me so why did you go... away.
I do recall now the smell of the rain,
Fresh on the pavement,
I ran off the plane,
That July ninth, the beat of your heart,
It jumps through your shirt I can still feel your arms.
But now I'll go sit on the floor wearing your clothes,
All that I know is I don't know,
How to be something you miss.
Never thought we'd have a last kiss
Never imagined we'd end like this
Your name forever the name on my lips
I do remember the swing of your step
The life of the party you're showing off again
And I roll my eyes and then you pulled me in.
I'm not much for dancing,
But for you I did because
I loved your handshake meeting my father
I love how you walk with your hands in your pockets
How you'd kiss me when I was in the middle of saying something.
There's not a day I don't miss those rude interruptions and
I'll go sit on the floor wearing your clothes,
All that I know is I don't know, how to be something you miss.
Never thought we'd have a last kiss
Never imagined we'd end like this
Your name forever the name on my lips
So I'll watch your life in pictures like I used to watch you sleep and
I'll feel you forget me like I use to feel you breathe and
I'll keep up with our old friends just to ask them how you are.
Hope it's nice where you are and
I hope the sun shines and it's a beautiful day and
Something reminds you,
You wish you had stayed we can plan for a change in weather and time,
I never planned on you changing your mind.
I'll go sit on the floor wearing your clothes,
All that I know is I don't know, how to be something you miss.
Never thought we'd have a last kiss
Never imagined we'd end like this
Your name forever the name on my lips,
Just like our last kiss,
Forever the name on my lips,
Forever the name on my lips.
Just like our last
