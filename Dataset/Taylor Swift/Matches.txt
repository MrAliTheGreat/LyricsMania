I shined your shoes, I poured the wine, I gave you all of my time,
I patched your dance smile that your friends apparently is a crime
I gave you strength, you took my place and gave it to her
But last... There was love on the...
And when love hands me matches now I'm gonna burn it down.
I keyed her car, got my guitar and wrote this damn song,
Look what you found she's been around I hear the line's long
And don't you tell me to be nice, I'm not a nice girlshe died of complications from the things you told her
So when love hands me matches now I'm gonna burn it down.
Any funny you said honey you... Dark,
But I say cheater, liar, truck on fire, looser, lavor to see...
Just a few I thought of,
And when love hands me matches now I'm gonna burn it down.
Ohh I'm gonna burn it down, burn it, burn it, burn it down, matches now.
