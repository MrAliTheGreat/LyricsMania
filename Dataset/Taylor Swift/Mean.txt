You, with your words like knives,
And swords and weapons that you use against me.
You, have knocked me off my feet again,
Got me feeling like a nothing.
You, with your voice like nails on a chalk board, calling me out when I'm wounded.
You, picking on the weaker man.
You can take me downnn,
But you don't know,
What you don't know!
Someday, I'll be, living in a big ol' city,
And all you're ever gonna be is mean.
Someday, I'll be, big enough so you can't hit me,
And all you're ever gonna be is mean.
Why you gotta be so mean?
You, with your switching sides,
And your wildfire lies, and your humiliation.
You, have pointed out my flaws again.
As if I don't already see them.
I walk with my head down,
Trying to block you out, cause I'll never impress you.
I just want to feel okay again.
Somebody made you cold.
But the cycle ends right now.
Because you can't lead me down that road.
And you don't know,
What you don't know.
Someday I'll be living in a big ol' city,
And all you're ever gonna be is mean.
Someday I'll be,
Big enough so you can't hit me.
And all you're ever gonna be is mean.
Why you gotta be so mean?
And I can see you years from now, in a bar,
Talking over a football game.
With that same big loud opinion,
But nobody's listening.
Washed up and ranting about the same old bitter things.
Drunk and grumbling on about,
How I can't sing.
But all you are is mean.
All you are is mean,
And a liar,
And pathetic,
And alone in life.
And mean, and mean, and mean, and mean!
But someday I'll be living in a big ol' city,
And all you're ever gonna be is mean.
Someday I'll be big enough so you can't hit me,
And all you're ever gonna be is mean.
Why you gotta be so mean?
Someday I'll be living in a big ol' city,
And all you're ever gonna be is mean.
Someday I'll be big enough so you can't hit me,
And all you're ever gonna be is mean.
Why you gotta be so mean?
