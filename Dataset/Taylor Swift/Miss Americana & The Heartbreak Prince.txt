You know I adore you, I'm crazier for you
Than I was at 16, lost in a film scene
Waving homecoming queens, marching band playing
I'm lost in the lights
American glory faded before me
Now I'm feeling hopeless, ripped up my prom dress
Running through rose thorns, I saw the scoreboard
No cameras catch my pageant smile
I counted days, I counted miles
To see you there, to see you there
It's been a long time coming, but
It's you and me, that's my whole world
The whole school is rolling fake dice
You play stupid games, you win stupid prizes
It's you and me, there's nothing like this
We're so sad, we paint the town blue
Voted most likely to run away with you
My team is losing, battered and bruising
I see the high fives between the bad guys
Leave with my head hung, you are the only one
Who seems to care
American stories burning before me
I'm feeling helpless, the damsels are depressed
Boys will be boys then, where are the wise men?
No cameras catch my muffled cries
I counted days, I counted miles
To see you there, to see you there
And now the storm is coming, but
It's you and me, that's my whole world
The whole school is rolling fake dice
You play stupid games, you win stupid prizes
It's you and me, there's nothing like this
We're so sad, we paint the town blue
Voted most likely to run away with you
It's you and me, that's my whole world
They whisper in the hallway, "She's a bad, bad girl"
Voted most likely to run away with you
It's you and me, that's my whole world
They whisper in the hallway, "She's a bad, bad girl"
"She's a bad, bad girl"
