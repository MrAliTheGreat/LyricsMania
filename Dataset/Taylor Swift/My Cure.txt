I know we've got a lot to say
Between now and forever
But I'd be a game if you would play
And I dare this to get better
Somewhere throughout the day
You smile and walk away
All I can think to do
Is follow you
If you ever leave I'll be crawlin' back for more
If you ever need love I'm standin' at your door
I'll be sick inside if baby you would be my cure
Wherever you think I am tonight
Just know we're that miles from a heartbreak
Beacause in the blink of a pretty brown eye
I'll be right where you are baby
Sometime along the way you take my breath away
Distracted by the view
I fall right into you
And if you ever leave I'll be crawlin' back for more
And if you ever need love I'm standin' at your door
I'll be sick inside if baby you would be my cure
They say I need to see all the people out there waitin'
But you take one look at me
And I know the mistake I'll be makin'
Cuz if you ever leave I'll be crawlin' back for more
And if you ever need my love I'm standin' at your door
I'll be sick inside if baby you would be my cure
I know we've got a lot to say between now and forever
