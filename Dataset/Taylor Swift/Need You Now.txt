I need you now
Read letters that i wrote on the wall
And the message that i left on my car
I need you now
Words that said drowned out by the rain
Waiting there for you but you never came
My world's a little colder now
But i'm keeping warm somehow
So here you are at my window
Guess nobody told you
I don't need you, don't need you
And i waited so frustrated
Who's gonna hold you
I don't need you, don't need you now
I need you now
Words i heard you whispered to me
And we will walk you down a one-way street
You need me now
That's what you've been telling my friends
But i'd come too far to go back there again
My heart, my mind, my mother's a chain
Your mind as well forget my name
So here you are at my window
Guess nobody told you
I don't need you, don't need you
And i waited so frustrated
Who's gonna hold you
I don't need you, don't need you now
