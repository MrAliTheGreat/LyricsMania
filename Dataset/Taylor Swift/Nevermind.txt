Look at you, look at me
Look at who we could be
I wanna know who you are
Watch you from the stars
And everytime I look at you
I can hardly say a thing
My head starts to spin
And it hits me then, I love you
And everytime you look at me
I could go crazy but I don't
Say it but I won't
Cause I'd rather be alone than lose you
And all I really wanna do is be next to you
But I'm too tired to fight
And I could tell you now
But baby, never mind
All the time, everyday
There's nothing I can do, baby
To make it go away
So look at you and look at me
I think of who we could be
And everytime I look at you
I can hardly say a thing
My head starts to spin
And it hits me then, I love you
And everytime you look at me
I could go crazy but I don't
Say it but I won't
Cause I'd rather be alone than lose you
And all I really wanna do is be next to you
But I'm too tired to fight
And I could tell you now
But never mind
All I really wanna say is I need you, babe
But how could you understand?
What happens when you turn away?
And everything turns blue and gray
And I just wish I told you never mind
And I could tell you now
But baby, never mind
Yeah, yeah
Oh yeah
And I could tell you now but never mind
