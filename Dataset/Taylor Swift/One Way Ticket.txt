Standing on the border
Looking out into the great unknown
I can feel my heart beating faster
As I step out on my own
There's a new horizon
And the promise of favorable wind
I'm heading out tonight,
Traveling light
I'm gonna start all over again
And buy a one-way ticket
On a west bound train
See how far I can go
Cause I'm gonna go out
Dancing in the pouring rain
And talk to someone I don't know
I will face the world around me
Knowing that I'm strong enough
To let you go
And I will fall in love again
Because I can
Gonna climb the mountain
And look the eagle in the eye
I won't let fear clip my wings
And tell me how high I can fly
How could I have ever believed
That love had to be so blind
When freedom was waiting, d
Own at the station
All I had to do
Was make up my mind
And buy a one-way ticket
On a west bound train
See how far I can go
Cause I'm gonna go out
Dancing in the pouring rain
And talk to someone I don't know
I will face the world around me
Knowing that I'm strong enough
To let you go
And I will fall in love again
Because I can
I have walked through the fire
And crawled on my knees
Through the valley
Of the shadow of doubt
Then the truth came shining
Like a light on me
And now I can see my way out
Buy a one-way ticket
On a west bound train
See how far I can go
Cause I'm gonna go out
Dancing in the pouring rain
And talk to someone I don't know
Buy a one-way ticket
On a west bound train
I'm gonna have my breakfast
With some pink champagne
Gonna sail the ocean,
Gonna spread my wings
Gonna climb that mountain,
Gonna do everything
