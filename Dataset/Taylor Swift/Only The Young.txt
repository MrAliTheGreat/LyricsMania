It keeps me awake, the look on your face
The moment you heard the news
You're screaminginsideand frozen intime
You did all that you coulddo
The game was rigged, the ref got tricked
The wrong ones think theyre right
You were outnumbered this time
But only the young, only the young
Only the young, only the young
Can run
Can run
So run, and run, and run
So every day now
You brace for the sound you've only heard on TV
You go to class, scared
Wondering where the best hiding spot would be
And the big bad man and his big bad clan
Their hands are stained with red
Oh, how quickly they forget
They aren't gonna help us
Too busy helping themselves
They aren't gonna change this
We gotta do it ourselves
They think that it's over
But it's just begun
Only one thing can save us
Only the young
Only the young
Only the young
Can run
Don't say you're too tired to fight
Don't say you're too tired to fight
Only the young
Only the young
Only the young
