Long handwritten note, deep in your pocket
Words, how little they mean when you're a little too late
I stood right by the tracks, your face in a locket
Good girls, hopeful they'll be and long they will wait
We had...
A beautiful, magic love there
What a sad...
Beautiful, tragic love affair
In dreams, I meet you in warm conversation
We both wake in lonely beds, different cities
And time is taking its sweet time erasing you
And you've got your demons, and darling
They all look like me, 'cause
We had...
A beautiful, magic love there
What a sad...
Beautiful, tragic love affair
Distance, timing, breakdown, fighting
Silence, the train runs off its tracks
Kiss me, try to fix it
Could you just try to listen?
Hang up, give up and for the life of us
We can't get back...
A beautiful magic love there
What a sad...
Beautiful, tragic, beautiful, tragic
We had...
A beautiful, magic love there
What a sad...
Beautiful, tragic love affair
We had...
A beautiful, magic love there
What a sad...
Beautiful, tragic love affair
