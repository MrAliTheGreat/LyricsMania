I stay out too late
Got nothing in my brain
That's what people say, um-um
That's what people say, um-um
I go on too many dates
But I can't make them stay
At least that's what people say, um-um,
That's what people say, um-um
But I keep cruising, can't stop
Won't stop moving
It's like I got this music in my mind sayin'
It's gonna be alright
Cause the players gonna play, play, play, play, play
And the haters gonna hate, hate, hate, hate, hate
Baby, I'm just gonna shake, shake, shake, shake, shake
I shake it off, I shake it off
Heartbreakers gonna break, break, break, break, break
And the fakers gonna fake, fake, fake, fake, fake
Baby, I'm just gonna shake, shake, shake, shake, shake
I shake it off, I shake it off
I'll never miss a beat
I'm lightning on my feet
And that's what they don't see, umm-umm
That's what they don't see, um-um
I'm dancing on my own
I'll make the moves up as I go
And that's what they don't know, um-um
That's what they don't know, um-um
But I keep cruising, can't stop
Won't stop grooving
It's like I got this music in my body and
It's gonna be alright
'Cause the players gonna play, play, play, play, play
And the haters gonna hate, hate, hate, hate, hate
Baby, I'm just gonna shake, shake, shake, shake, shake
I shake it off, I shake it off
Heartbreakers gonna break, break, break, break, break
And the fakers gonna fake, fake, fake, fake, fake
Baby, I'm just gonna shake, shake, shake, shake, shake
I shake it off, I shake it off
I, I shake it off
I shake it off
I, I shake it off
I shake it off
Hey, hey, hey
Just think while
You've been
Getting down
And out about the liars and dirty, dirty cheats
In the world
You could have been
Getting down to
This sick beat
My ex-man bought his new girlfriend
She's like oh my God, but I'm just gonna shake it
And to the fella over there with the hecka good hair
Won't you come on over, baby, we can shake, shake, shake
'Cause the players gonna play, play, play, play, play
And the haters gonna hate, hate, hate, hate, hate
Baby, I'm just gonna shake, shake, shake, shake, shake
I shake it off, I shake it off
Heartbreakers gonna break, break, break, break, break
And the fakers gonna fake, fake, fake, fake, fake
Baby, I'm just gonna shake, shake, shake, shake, shake
I shake it off, I shake it off
I, I shake it off, I shake it off
I, I shake it off, I shake it off
