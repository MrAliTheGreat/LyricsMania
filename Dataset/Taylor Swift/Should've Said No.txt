It's strange to think the songs we used to sing
The smiles, the flowers, everything
Is gone
Yesterday I found out about you
Even now just looking at you
Feels wrong
You say
That you'd take it all back,
Given one chance
It was a moment of weakness
And you said yes
You should've said no,
You should've gone home
You should've thought twice 'fore you let it all go
You should've known the word of what you did with her'd
And I should've been there,
In the back of your mind
I shouldn't be asking myself why
You shouldn't be begging for forgiveness at my feet
You should've said no,
Baby and you might still have me
You can see that I've been crying
And baby you know all the right things
To say
But do you honestly expect me to believe
We could ever be the same
You say that the past is the past,
You need one chance
It was a moment of weakness
And you said yes
You should've said no,
You should've gone home
You should've thought twice 'fore you let it all go
You should've known the word of what you did with her'd
And I should've been there,
In the back of your mind
I shouldn't be asking myself why
You shouldn't be begging for forgiveness at my feet
You should've said no,
Baby and you might still have meeeeeeeee
Oh, oh, oh
I can't resist
Before you go, tell me this
Was it worth it?
Was she worth this?
Noooooooo, nooo
No, no, noooooo, nooo...
You should've said no,
You should've gone home
You should've thought twice 'fore you let it all go
You should've known the word of what you did with her'd
And I should've been there,
In the back of your mind
I shouldn't be asking myself why
You shouldn't be begging for forgiveness at my feet...
You should've said no,
Baby and you might still have me
