I'm falling down low,
No hand that I can hold,
I'm left behind,
They don't see the tears I cry.
I cuddle up,
Writing a song,
About how I feel,
They say that's crazy.
They don't understand my life,
And the ways that I cry,
Things are getting really hard,
Can't search on google for my love
These nights are sleepless,
These nights are cold,
Wish I could have somebody
Somebody to hold
Don't care if it's for one night,
I'll make do,
I just want somebody
Somebody to hold
They treat like me like I'm,
A mental patient,
Wish somebody,
Could be in sync with me.
They don't understand my life,
And the ways that I cry,
Things are getting really hard,
Can't search on google for my love
These nights are sleepless,
These nights are cold,
Wish I could have somebody
Somebody to hold
Don't care if it's for one night,
I'll make do,
I just want somebody
Somebody to hold
I hug the air,
When reality hits me
And no one's there.
Oh yeah
I hug the air
When reality hits me
I wish some one was there
These nights are sleepless,
These nights are cold,
Wish I could have somebody
Somebody to hold
Don't care if it's for one night,
I'll make do,
I just want somebody
Somebody to hold
