I am not the kind of girl
Who should be rudely barging in on a white veil occasion
But you are not the kind of boy
Who should be marrying the wrong girl
I sneak in and see your friends, and her snotty little family
All dressed in pastel
And she is yelling at a bridesmaid, somewhere back inside a room
Wearing a gown shaped like a pastry
This is surely not what you thought it would be
I lose myself in a daydream where I stand and say
Dont say yes, run away now
Ill meet you when youre out of the church at the backdoor
Dont wait or say a single vow
You need to hear me out and they said speak now
Fond gestures are exchanged
And the organ starts to play a song that sounds like a death march
And I am hiding in the curtains
It seems that I was uninvited by your lovely bride-to-be
She floats down the aisle like a pageant queen
But I know you wish it was me, you wish it was me
Dont you?
Dont say yes, run away now
Ill meet you when youre out of the church at the backdoor
Dont wait or say a single vow
You need to hear me out and they said speak now
So dont say yes, run away now
Ill meet you when youre out of the church at the backdoor
Dont wait or say a single vow
Your time is running out and they said speak now
I hear the preacher say speak now or forever hold your peace
Theres the silence, theres my last chance
I stand up with shaking hands, all eyes on me
Horrified looks from everyone in the room
But Im only looking at you
I am not the kind of girl
Who should be rudely barging in on a white veil occasion
But you are not the kind of boy
Who should be marrying the wrong girl
Dont say yes, run away now
Ill meet you when youre out of the church at the backdoor
Dont wait or say a single vow
You need to hear me out and they said speak now
And you say lets run away now
Ill meet when Im out of my tux at the backdoor
Baby I didnt say my vows, so glad you were around
When they said Speak now
