You were the guy I always dreamed of.
You were the guy that I loved. But then you had to leave me.
I asked when you would call me.
You replied meet me at the wildernes at nine.
I went there standin waitin to see your face.
... You never showed up I was there for hours,
I was watin to see your face.
I'll stand here for hours under this lonly spot light.
I'll wait all night till I see your face.
Ohh waitin to see your face.
I went to the mall with all my friends to see if you
Were there I saw you with another girl I didn't think
To swear. I wen home crying to see if you were there
If a message was left I would cry my tears.
I was watin to see your face.
I'll stand here for hours under this lonly spot light.
I'll wait all night till I see your face.
Ohh waitin to see your face.
Then I had your call for me and I saw your face lookin
At me I was glad to see! We went we cried to the the
Wilderness I'm not alone.
Under the spot light any more... Any more any more any more!
