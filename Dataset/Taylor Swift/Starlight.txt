I said oh my, what a marvelous tune
It was the best night, never would forget how he moved
The whole place was dressed to the nines, and we were dancing dancing
Like we're made of starlight
Like we're made of starlight
I met Bobby on the boardwalk, summer of '45
Picks me up, play one night at the window he was 17 and crazy, running wild wild
Can't remember what song it was playing when we walked in
The night we snuck into a yacht club party
Pretending to be a duchess and a prince
And I said oh my, what a marvelous tune
It was the best night, never would forget how he moved
The whole place was dressed to the nines, and we were dancing dancing
Like we're made of starlight starlight
Like we're made of starlight starlight
He said, "Look at you, worrying too much about things you can't change.
You'll spend your whole life singing the blues, you keep thinking that way. "
He was trying to skip rocks on the ocean saying to me
Don't you see the starlight starlight?
Don't you dream impossible things?
Like oh my, what a marvelous tune
It was the best night, never would forget how he moved
The whole place was dressed to the nines, and we were dancing dancing
Like we're made of starlight starlight
Like we're made of starlight starlight
Ooh ooh he's talking crazy
Ooh ooh dancing with me
Ooh ooh we could get married
Have ten kids and teach 'em how to dream
Oh my, what a marvelous tune
It was the best night, never would forget how he moved
The whole place was dressed to the nines, and we were dancing dancing
Like we're made of starlight, starlight
Like we're made of starlight, starlight
Like we're made of starlight, starlight
Like we dream impossible dreams
Like starlight, starlight
Like we dream impossible dreams
Don't you see the starlight, starlight?
Don't you dream impossible things?
